# Change parameters in string dynamically

Let say we have a string like: 

"Dear {{1}}, On {{2}} at {{3}} you have an appointment scheduled with us for your {{4}}. We look forward to seeing you fifteen minutes in advance at our garage on the {{5}} in {{6}}. See you then!"

{{1}} indicate the parameters, and the number inside double curly bracket indicate how many parameters are inside the string.
So this project is just an example how to change those parameters dinamically, based on how many parameters are.
